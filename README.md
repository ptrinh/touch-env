# touch-env

**API keys behind your fingerprint: no app, script or AI agent reads them without your touch.**

<p align="center"><img src="docs/touch-id-prompt.png" width="260" alt="Touch ID prompt: Allow Claude Code to read OPENAI_API_KEY from your Keychain? Intent: make the monthly sales report. More detail shows the command."></p>

## Why

Keys in `.env` files can be taken by anything that reads files: a hacked dev server, malware, or an AI agent tricked
by a web page. touch-env moves them into the Mac's Keychain. Each use shows **who** wants **which key** and **why**;
only your finger says yes.

## Install

macOS 13 or later:

```sh
brew install --cask ptrinh/tap/touchenv
```

Or unzip the app from [Releases](https://github.com/ptrinh/touch-env/releases/latest) into `~/Applications` and
link `touchenv.app/Contents/MacOS/touchenv` into your `PATH`.

## Use

```sh
touchenv set OPENAI_API_KEY                  # save (paste it; not shown)
touchenv set MY_KEY < AuthKey.p8             # save a key file
touchenv set --sync OPENAI_API_KEY           # save and sync to your other Macs (see below)
touchenv run OPENAI_API_KEY -- python report.py
touchenv run MY_KEY:file -- fastlane beta    # the command gets a temp file path, deleted afterwards
touchenv run --intent "monthly report" OPENAI_API_KEY -- python report.py   # shows why in the prompt
touchenv ls                                  # names only, no Touch ID
touchenv get NAME · touchenv rm NAME
```

Delete the original files after saving.

**AI assistants:** add to `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`:

> My secrets are in touchenv. Never read key files. Use `touchenv run --intent "<why>" NAME -- <command>`.

Claude Code also needs `"touchenv *"` in `sandbox.excludedCommands`.

## Good to know

- **Read before you touch.** An approved command can do anything with the key. The intent is written by the asker;
  check the command under **More detail**.
- **No Touch ID?** It asks for your Mac password.
- Old copies of a key (files, backups, shell history) are still yours to delete.
- **`--sync` is weaker.** iCloud Keychain won't take the Mac's own Touch ID lock, so only touchenv guards synced keys:

  | If… | Local key | Synced key |
  |---|---|---|
  | Malware runs as you | Safe | Safe |
  | Attacker has admin and disables SIP, or a macOS bug | Still needs your finger | **Readable** |
  | Another Mac on your Apple Account is hacked | Not there | **Exposed** |

  Keep signing keys and admin tokens local.

## For developers

One Swift file, [`touchenv.swift`](touchenv.swift). Local keys: Data Protection keychain, `userPresence`,
`WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`. Synced keys: `kSecAttrSynchronizable`, no access control (iCloud refuses one). Both
sit in an access group only the signed app holds. The prompt embeds `LAAuthenticationView` (no Allow button); the
Touch ID icon comes from macOS, with a copy in `Resources/`.

Building needs a paid Apple Developer account: an App ID, a Developer ID provisioning profile, and the values in the
header of `build.sh` put in `build.local`. Then `./build.sh`. Your build can't read keys saved by the prebuilt app;
move them with `old run A:file -- sh -c 'touchenv set A < "$A"'`.
